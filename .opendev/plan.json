  "wiringRules": [
    "Rule 1: AuthProvider (src/context/auth-provider.tsx) is the SINGLE source of truth for authentication state. It stores claudeToken and githubToken. All pages and API calls must read auth tokens from AuthProvider via useContext, never from localStorage directly. AuthProvider must be initialized in the root layout BEFORE GitDataProvider.",
    "Rule 2: GitDataProvider (src/context/git-data-provider.tsx) is the SINGLE source of truth for all fetched git data (repos, commits, contributors, languages). It wraps the app inside AuthProvider. Pages must NOT fetch git data independently — they must call GitDataProvider methods (fetchRepos, fetchCommits, etc.) which internally use github-api.ts and cache-manager.ts.",
    "Rule 3: The app-store (zustand) manages UI state: selectedRepos[], processingStatus, currentWrappedSlide, gourcePlaybackState. Pages read from this store via hooks. The Connect page writes selectedRepos, Dashboard/Story/Wrapped/Gource pages read them. If selectedRepos is empty, Dashboard/Story/Wrapped/Gource pages must redirect to /connect.",
    "Rule 4: Data fetching flow: Connect page → user selects repos → app-store.setSelectedRepos() → user clicks Generate → GitDataProvider.fetchCommitsForRepos(selectedRepos) → commits stored in GitDataProvider → app-store.setProcessingStatus('analyzing') → API route /api/analytics/compute processes data → results stored in GitDataProvider → app-store.setProcessingStatus('idle') → redirect to /dashboard.",
    "Rule 5: Analytics computation chain: Raw commits from GitDataProvider → analytics-engine.ts functions (computeContributionHeatmap, computeCommitFrequency, etc.) → useAnalytics hook memoizes results → Dashboard/Wrapped components consume via hook. The useAnalytics hook must recompute ONLY when GitDataProvider's commit data or app-store's selectedRepos changes.",
    "Rule 6: Story generation chain: User navigates to /story → useStoryGenerator checks GitDataProvider for commits → calls commit-processor.ts to batch/summarize commits → sends batched summaries to /api/story/generate (which calls claude-api.ts) → streaming response updates progress in useStoryGenerator → final stories cached in GitDataProvider via cache-manager.ts.",
    "Rule 7: Claude API integration: claude-api.ts requires the claudeToken from AuthProvider. The story/generate API route receives the token in the Authorization header. For repos with 1000+ commits, commit-processor.ts MUST summarize commits into batches of ~100 before sending to Claude. Each batch is summarized, then summaries are combined for final story generation. This prevents token limit issues.",
    "Rule 8: Wrapped slideshow flow: /wrapped page reads analytics from useAnalytics hook (which reads from GitDataProvider) → useWrappedSlideshow hook manages slide index and animation state → each slide component receives its specific data as props from the parent container → wrapped-slide-container.tsx handles transitions between slides. The page must set document body to overflow:hidden for fullscreen mode and restore on unmount.",
    "Rule 9: Gource engine initialization order: GourceEngine constructor receives commitData and repoMetadata → GourceLayout.initialize(commitData) builds initial node tree → GourceRenderer.initialize(canvasElement) sets up Canvas context → GourceEngine.start() begins requestAnimationFrame loop. The loop calls: GourceLayout.update(currentTime) → GourceRenderer.render(nodes, edges, avatars). useGourcePlayback hook controls play/pause/speed via GourceEngine methods.",
    "Rule 10: Gource data flow: GitDataProvider provides commits sorted by date → gource-engine.ts maintains a currentTimeIndex that advances based on playback speed → at each frame, new commits up to currentTime are processed: files are added/modified as nodes, contributors appear as avatars → gource-layout.ts computes positions using force-directed algorithm → gource-renderer.ts draws the scene. Canvas must be resized on window resize events.",
    "Rule 11: Cache strategy: cache-manager.ts uses IndexedDB via 'idb' package. Keys follow pattern: 'repos:{userId}', 'commits:{repoFullName}', 'analytics:{selectedRepoHash}', 'story:{repoFullName}', 'story:unified:{selectedRepoHash}'. TTL is 1 hour for commits, 24 hours for analytics and stories. GitDataProvider checks cache before API calls. Cache is cleared when selectedRepos changes.",
    "Rule 12: Repository detail page (/repo/[id]) reads repo data from GitDataProvider using the [id] param (which is the repo full name URL-encoded). It must NOT re-fetch from GitHub — it uses cached data from GitDataProvider. If data is not in GitDataProvider (user navigated directly), it fetches on mount and stores in GitDataProvider.",
    "Rule 13: GitHub OAuth flow: Connect page calls useGitHubAuth.initiateOAuth() → redirects to GitHub OAuth URL with client_id → GitHub redirects back to /api/github/callback → callback route exchanges code for token → stores token in httpOnly cookie → redirects to /connect with success param → useGitHubAuth detects token in cookie → sets isConnected=true in AuthProvider → triggers repo fetch.",
    "Rule 14: Navbar visibility: The root layout checks the current pathname. If pathname is '/wrapped', the navbar is hidden and the page renders fullscreen. For all other routes, navbar and footer are shown. This is handled via a client component wrapper in layout.tsx that uses usePathname().",
    "Rule 15: Ad placements: AdUnit from @/components/shared/ad-unit is imported and placed by page components (NOT the layout). Landing page places one AdUnit after features-overview section and one before cta-section. Dashboard places one AdUnit in the sidebar area. Maximum 2-3 ad units site-wide per page view. AdUnit must not render inside the /wrapped fullscreen experience.",
    "Rule 16: Share functionality: share-wrapped.tsx and share-story.tsx both use html2canvas to capture DOM elements as images. They must wait for all animations to complete before capturing. The captured image is offered as PNG download and can be shared via Web Share API (navigator.share) with fallback to clipboard copy. Share text templates come from wrapped-content.ts and story-prompts.ts.",
    "Rule 17: Error handling chain: All API calls (github-api.ts, claude-api.ts) throw typed errors → API routes catch and return appropriate HTTP status codes → GitDataProvider catches and stores errors in state → pages check for errors and display error UI with retry buttons. Rate limit errors from GitHub trigger a countdown timer showing when to retry.",
    "Rule 18: Commit processor batching strategy: For repos with <500 commits, all commits are sent to analytics-engine directly. For 500-5000 commits, commits are processed in chunks of 500 with intermediate results merged. For 5000+ commits, server-side processing via /api/analytics/compute is used. This threshold logic lives in GitDataProvider.fetchCommitsForRepos()."
